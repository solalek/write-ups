This is write-up for the challenge `picoCTF - Nice netcat...`.
The goal is to obtain flag from the netcat connection.
**Tools used:** Netcat, Python.

## Challenge Description

We are given the following host and port:
`mercury.picoctf.net 22342`

---

## Solution

Firstly, we connect to this host using netcat:
``` bash
nc mercury.picoctf.net 22342
```

Which gives the following output:
``` bash
âŸ© nc mercury.picoctf.net 22342                                                                                 11.2s

```

So then we should store this output to use it later:
``` bash
nc mercury.picoctf.net 22342 > letters
```

To convert these numbers into characters, we will use a Python script:
``` python
with open("letters", "r") as file:
     list_letters = file.readlines()
     for i in list_letters:
         print(chr(int(i)), end="")
```

Result:
``` bash
python translate.py 
picoCTF{g00d_k1tty!_n1c3_k1tty!_5fb5e51d}
```
